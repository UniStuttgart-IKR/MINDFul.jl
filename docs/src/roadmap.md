# Roadmap

`MINDFul.jl` is an effort meant to help parties interested in the reasearch of intent-driven network coordination.
Future additions are going to be determined by our research directions.
However the following consitute a list of plans that are irrelevant to research purposes
- complete substitution of `MetaGraphs` by `MetaGraphsNext`
- complete integration of `Term.jl`
- definition of line rate units with `Unitful.jl`
- companion package `MINDFulCompanion.jl` for better demonstration
