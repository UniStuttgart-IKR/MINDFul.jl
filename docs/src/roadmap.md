# Roadmap

`MINDFul.jl` is an effort meant to help parties interested in the reasearch of intent-driven network coordination.
Future additions are going to be determined by our research directions.
However the following consitute a list of plans that are irrelevant to research purposes
- complete substitution of [`MetaGraphs`](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/MetaGraphs.jl) by [`MetaGraphsNext`](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/MetaGraphsNext.jl)
- integration of [`Term.jl`](https://github.com/FedeClaudi/Term.jl) for more beautifl command-line operation
- definition of line rate units with [`Unitful.jl`](https://painterqubits.github.io/Unitful.jl/stable/)
- more user-friendly interfaces
