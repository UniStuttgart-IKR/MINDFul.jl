Welcome to `MINDFul.jl` documentation


MINDFul.jl is an open source tool for studying IP-optical intent-based networking.

Intents are compiled down to further lower level intets forming an Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
The leafs of the DAG are called "low level intents" and are basically hardware configurations for the devices.

There are currently 3 devices to consider:
- the node as a whole
- the router
- the optical cross connect (OXC)

For each of those devices a LLI is corresponding

MINDFul.jl was rewritten. Better docs soon.
