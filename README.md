# IBNFramework
A full stack IBN Framework.
It is envisioned to work flexibly with several SDN controllers (e.g. ONOS, ODL), once the appropriate interfaces are built.

For testing purposes and easier research on algorithms a dummy SDN controller is provided to connect with simulated network resources (`SimNetResou.jl`)
For the initial purpose of the package only the simulated network will be developed.

# Multi Domains
A basic priority of the package is to consider multi-domain networks with partial knowledge.

# Modularity
The package is built in a way to allow experimentation with different algorithms and dynamic relationships between the domains.
